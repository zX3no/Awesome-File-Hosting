# Awesome file hosting

I'm amazed at how horrible file hosting websites are. 
They are difficult to navigate without an ad-blocker, ask for seemingly impossible captcha's, and after all that they download at 50 KB/s.

Surely in 2022 we've overcome such limitations?

## Websites

All of the following are: 
- Easy to use
- Don't require an account 
- Have fast download speeds
- Limited or no ads
